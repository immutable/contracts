 * @title OwnableCreate3Deployer
 * @notice The contract deploys contracts to deterministic addresses using the `CREATE3` method.
 *         This address of deployed contracts depends only on the deployer address, and a provided salt.
 *         Unlike the `CREATE2` deployment approach implemented in {OwnableCreate2Deployer}, the address of
 *         contracts does not depend on the bytecode of the contract or constructor parameters.
 *
 * @dev This contract extends the {Deployer} contract from the Axelar SDK, by adding basic access control to the deployment functions.
 *      The contract has an owner, which is the only entity that can deploy new contracts.
 *
 * @dev The contract deploys a contract with the same salt and sender to the same address.
 *      The address where a contract will be deployed can be found using {deployedAddress}.
 *
 * @dev The contract deploys an single use intermediary contract using the `CREATE2` opcode, and then uses the intermediary contract to deploy the new contract using the `CREATE` opcode.
 *      The intermediary contract is an instance of the {OwnableCreateDeploy} contract and can only be called by this contract.
