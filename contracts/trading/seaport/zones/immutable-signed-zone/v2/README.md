# Immutable Signed Zone (v2)

The Immutable Signed Zone contract is a [Seaport Zone](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/seaport-hooks#zone-hooks) that implements [SIP-7 (Interface for Server-Signed Orders)](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/SIPs/blob/main/SIPS/sip-7.md) with support for [substandards](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/SIPs/blob/main/SIPS/sip-7.md#substandards) 3, 4 and 6.

This zone is used by Immutable to enable:

* Enforcement of protocol, royalty and ecosystem fees
* Off-chain order cancellation

## Architecture

The trading system on the Immutable platform is shown in the diagram below.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  client[Client] <-- 1. POST .../fulfillment-data ---> ob[Immutable Off-Chain\nOrderbook]
  client -- 2. fulfillAdvancedOrder ---> seaport[ImmutableSeaport.sol]
  seaport -- 3a. transferFrom --> erc20[IERC20.sol]
  seaport -- 3b. transferFrom --> erc721[IERC721.sol]
  seaport -- 3c. safeTransferFrom --> erc1155[IERC1155.sol]
  seaport -- 4. validateOrder --> Zone
  subgraph Zone
    direction TB
    zone[ImmutableSignedZoneV2.sol] --> AccessControlEnumerable.sol
  end
```

The sequence of events is as follows:

1. The client makes a HTTP `POST .../fulfillment-data` request to the Immutable Orderbook, which will construct and sign an `extraData` payload to return to the client
2. The client calls `fulfillAdvancedOrder` or `fulfillAvailableAdavancedOrders` on `ImmutableSeaport.sol` to fulfill an order
3. `ImmutableSeaport.sol` executes the fufilment by transferring items between parties
4. `ImmutableSeaport.sol` calls `validateOrder` on `ImmutableSignedZoneV2.sol`, passing it the fulfilment execution details as well as the `extraData` parameter
5. `ImmutableSignedZoneV2.sol` validates the fulfilment execution details using the `extraData` payload, reverting if expectations are not met

## Differences compared to ImmutableSignedZone (v1)

The contract was developed based on ImmutableSignedZone, with the addition of:
 - SIP7 substandard 6 support
 - Role based access control to be role based

### ZoneAccessControl

The contract now uses a finer grained access control with role based access with the `ZoneAccessControl` interface, rather than the `Ownable` interface in the v1 contract. A seperate `zoneManager` roles is used to manage signers and an admin role used to control roles.

### Support of SIP7 substandard 6

The V2 contract now supports substandard-6 of the SIP7 specification, found here (https://github.com/immutable/platform-services/pull/12775). A server side signed order can adhere to substandard 3 + 4 (full fulfillment only) or substandard 6 + 4 (full or partial fulfillment).
