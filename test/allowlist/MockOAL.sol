    OperatorAllowlist is an implementation of a Allowlist registry, storing addresses and bytecode
    which are allowed to be approved operators and execute transfers of interfacing token contracts (e.g. ERC721/ERC1155).
    The registry will be a deployed contract that tokens may interface with and point to.
    OperatorAllowlist is not designed to be upgradeable or extended.
