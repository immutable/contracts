# Test plan for ImmutableSignedZone

ImmutableSignedZone is a implementation of the SIP-7 specification with substandard 3.

## E2E tests with signing server

E2E tests will be handled in the server repository seperate to the contract.

## Validate order unit tests

The core function of the contract is `validateOrder` where signature verification and a variety of validations of the `extraData` payload is verified by the zone to determine whether an order is considered valid for fulfillment. This function will be called by the settlement contract upon order fulfillment.
