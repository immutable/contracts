# Seaport 1.6 Test Code

The code in this directory is the same as the Seaport 1.5 tests (in [../seaport](../seaport/)), with the following exceptions:

* All references to Immutable's Seaport implementation are to the 1.6 implementation.
* All references to seaport, seaport-core, and seaport-types are to seaport-16, seaport-core-16, and seaport-types-16.
* All references to test/trading/seaport/utils has been updated to use the version in the seaport 1.5 directory. These files have not changed as they do not reference Seaport.
* Immutable signed zone v2 has been renamed to v3.
